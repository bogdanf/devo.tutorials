I hope that you've found this tutorial series helpful and worth your time.  Terraform is powerful and can make managing your cloud environments easy and efficient.  While our time together has been great, we've only had time to scratch the surface!

Before parting ways, there are several resources that I've curated with the hope that it'll help expand your skills and experience around using Terraform with OCI.  Without further ado:

## Terraform Modules

We haven't had a chance to talk about modules, but they're a great way to extend and scale Terraform.  Here are a few places to look for OCI Terraform modules:

* [HashiCorp Terraform Module Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=oci)
* [github.com/oracle-devrel](https://github.com/oracle-devrel)
* [github.com/oracle-terraform-modules/](https://github.com/oracle-terraform-modules/)
* [github.com/oracle-quickstart](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart)

## Terraform Projects

There are Terraform projects for many common applications just waiting for you to deploy:

* [Oracle Architecture Center](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/architecture-center/)
* [github.com/oracle-devrel](https://github.com/oracle-devrel)
* [github.com/oracle-quickstart](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart)

## Terraform Documentation

There's a plethora of great documentation on the [terraform.io](https://terraform.io) site.  Be sure to check it out and go through the documentation and learning guides!

For OCI-specific documentation, check out:

* [OCI Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/oci/latest/docs)
* [Official OCI Terraform provider documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/terraform.htm)

Until we meet again, happy coding!
